# Leetcode Problems

Hi everyone, this is a working repo of all of my completed leetcode problems. 

# Project Structure

The root of the repo consist of directories organized by the programming language used for leetcode solutions.
  For example, problems for java will be labeled: "java-problems"", python - "python-problems" etc. These are the language directories.

## Language Directories

Within these directories are other sub-directories that are organized by diffculty level as such:
  - easy
  - medium
  - hard

## Difficulty Directories

Within each one of these "difficulty directories" are directories that are named after the leetcode problem in hand. Each directory will have a markdown file that contains a link to the leetcode problem that corresponds to the particular solution.

## Solution Directories

Within the difficulty directories will be solution directories. These directories hold solution files and pseudocode markdown files corresponding to the problem

# Pseudocode

One goal for creating this repository is to dilligently track efforts to improve on logical reasoning and algorithms. It is strongly believed that the prowess of writing algorithms is connected to logical reasoning. What better way to confirm that logical reasoning of a coding problem that using pseudocode! 

Each solution
