# Leetcode Problems

Hi everyone, this is a working repo of all of my completed leetcode problems. 

# Project Structure

The root of the repo consist of directories organized by the programming language used for leetcode solutions.
  
Within these directories are other sub-directories that are organized by diffculty level as such:
  - easy
  - medium
  - hard
  
Within each one of these "difficulty directories" are directories that are named after the leetcode problem in hand. Each directory will have a markdown file that contains a link to the leetcode problem that corresponds to the particular solution.

# Pseudocode

One goal for creating this repository is to dilligently track efforts to improve on logical reasoning and algorithms. It is strongly believed that the prowess of writing algorithms is connected to logical reasoning. What better way to confirm that logical reasoning of a coding problem that using pseudocode! 

  ## Finding Pseucode within the project
  
   Git comes in handy for this project because of commits. Each solution file will start with initial commits of psuedocode and gradually move to the completed implementation of the course of a series of commits. All you need to do is check the version history of the file in question.
