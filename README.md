# Leetcode Problems

Hi everyone, this is a working repo of all of my completed leetcode problems. 

# Project Structure

## Language Directories

The root of the repo consist of directories organized by the programming language used for leetcode solutions.
  For example, problems for java will be labeled: "java-problems"", python - "python-problems" etc. These are the language directories.

## Difficulty Directories

Within the root of the project language directories are other sub-directories that are organized by diffculty level as such:
  - easy
  - medium
  - hard

## Solution Directories

Within the difficulty directories will be solution directories. These directories hold solution files and pseudocode markdown files corresponding to the problem

# Pseudocode

One goal for creating this repository is to dilligently track efforts to improve on logical reasoning and algorithms. It is strongly believed that the prowess of writing algorithms is connected to logical reasoning. What better way to confirm that logical reasoning of a coding problem that using pseudocode!
